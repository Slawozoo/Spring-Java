# CRUD Operations in REST API
In this project, I have built an Rest API for CRUD operations of model Author.
For Each of the CRUD operation, I have done that using two methods as:</br>
	1.**Using JPA**</br>
	2.**Criteria Api**</br>
For this project, I have created a table name called Authors with authorid as primary key.
