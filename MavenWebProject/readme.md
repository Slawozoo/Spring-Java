# CRUD Operations in Spring Maven MVC
I have done this project using only JPA and repository for CRUD operations  in Springboot.
I have created Authors table with authorid as primary key along with field name first_name, last_name, address, institution, email.
I have used postgres for my DB.

I have also integrated Spring Security in this project with User Registration and Login. Also Roles and Permissions are also included
with 'CUSTOMER' and 'ADMIN'. User with 'ADMIN' role can perform every activities whereas 'CUSTOMER' can only view the Authors.

I hope this project will provide some knowledge to those who are trying to seek knowledge and skills in Spring Maven using Model View Controller(MVC).
