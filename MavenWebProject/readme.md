# CRUD Operations in Spring Maven MVC
I have done this project using only JPA and repository for CRUD operations  in Springboot.
I have created Authors table with authorid as primary key along with field name first_name, last_name, address, institution, email.
I have used postgres for my DB.
I hope this project will provide some knowledge to those who are trying to seek knowledge and skills in Spring Maven using Model View Controller(MVC).
